# Project-2 Retail Store Opening Decision Making
# Problem Statement: o predict if a store should be opened in a particular area depending on sales, population, area, etc.
# Aim: To Build a machine learning predictive model and predict the accurate Store Opening requirement.The evalution metric will be AUC.
# Data: This data set is related with retail domain and challenge is to predict whether a store should get opened or not based on certain factors such as sales, population,area etc. They have given two datasets , store_train.csv and store_test.csv . We need to use data store_train to build predictive model for response variable ‘store’. store_test data contains all other factors except ‘store’, we need to predict that using the model developed
# Methodology: We will build a ML - Random Forest model to predict the response variable.
